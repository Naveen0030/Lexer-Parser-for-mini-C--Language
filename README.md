# Lax and Yacc are used for lexical analysis and parsing, respectively.             

### Lax (Lexical Analyzer) , is a lexical analyzer that breaks up an input stream into more usable elements, such as tokens. Its main job is to identify the “interesting bits” in a text file. For example, in a compiler for the C programming language, the symbols {}, (), and ; have significance on their own, while the letter a usually appears as part of a keyword or variable name.

### Yacc (Yet Another Compiler-Compiler) , is a parser generator that takes as input a specification of a syntax and produces as output a procedure for recognizing that language. It is a program that handles the input process and can be used to create a parser for a specific language. Yacc is often used to give structure to the tokens produced by Lax. 

Lax can be used to create a compiler for a programming language, breaking up the input stream into tokens such as keywords, identifiers, and symbols.

Yacc can be used to create a parser for a specific language, analyzing the structure of the input stream and recognizing the language’s syntax.
